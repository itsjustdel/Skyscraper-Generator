# Skyscraper-Generator
This project was initially supposed to be a lamp post generator, but I quickly realised the shapes I was getting out of my algorithm were more akin to sci-fi cityscapes so I pivoted the project. At this point in my devolopment I was using the yearly [ProcJam](https://www.procjam.com/) event as a motivational deadline to showcase my work and whilst I was pleased with the buildings being generated, my inability to design a decent interface to allow a user to play with the algorithm, disappoints me everytime I play with the demo. I have learned there is no point in creating something which, behind the scenes may be complex and impressive, if a user can not interact it on the terms I can as the developer. However, seeing the ray traced renders of the output always make me feel I captured something special.
